📁 Project Name: Scalable Media Backend API (YouTube-style Architecture)


📝 Description:

Developed a scalable and modular backend system inspired by YouTube’s architecture, using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Multer to efficiently handle large media uploads in chunked format. Implemented JWT-based authentication, MongoDB aggregation pipelines, and middleware-based validation to optimize performance, security, and data integrity.



Key highlights:

Enabled efficient video/file uploads using Multer with chunked processing to reduce memory overhead and enhance scalability.

Used MongoDB aggregation pipeline for complex queries like trending content, user statistics, and search filters with minimal latency.

Designed role-based JWT authentication for secure access control and session management.

Established clean architecture with reusable controllers, services, and route handling to support team collaboration and rapid scaling.

Integrated best practices for version control, error handling, and modular design, making it easy for development teams to onboard and extend functionality.
